// This test is going to create volume on the fresh testbed very first time.
// After installing vmdk volume plugin/driver, volume creation should not be

// This test is going to cover the issue reported at #656
// TODO: as of now we are running the test against photon vm it should be run
// against various/applicable linux distros.

// Test objective: create volume on fresh setup very first time and verifies the volume

/*

The issue was observed on photon so steps are mentioned for photon OS only in fact
test should be OS agnostic.

1. create docker volume using following command
	docker volume create --driver=vsphere --name=testVol -o size=10gb
2. verify volume is created correctly or not
3. delete created volume

expectation: volume should be created correctly
